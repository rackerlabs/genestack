# Summary

GeneStack's multi-region and hybrid design, leveraging OpenStack and Kubernetes, provides a robust foundation for cloud-native workloads. By integrating layered security practices, you can enhance resilience against evolving threats. Regular audits, continuous improvement, and adherence to cloud-native security principles are vital for maintaining a secure environment.

Lets summarize our layered security approach in a table:

| Lifecycle Phase     | Infrastructure                       | Platform                             | Application                    | Data                                    |
| :---------:         | :----------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------:| :-----------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| **Develop**         | Secure IaC, Validate Nodes           | Harden Platform Configs              | Secure code, container images  |Encrypt sensitive configuration and data |
| **Distribute**      | Validate Container/VM Images         | Secure API and configuration delivery| Verify container integrity     |Protect data during distribution         |
| **Deploy**          | Handen Deployed Nodes                | Enforce RBAC and security policies   | Apply runtime policies         |Encrypt data in transit                  |
| **Runtime**         | Monitor and Remediate Issues         | Detect API issues and misuse         | Monitor and secure workloads   |Protect sensitive data streams           |


By integrating these practices our security approach ensures comprehensive protection across the entire lifecycle of Genestack based OpenStack cloud.
