[Genestack](index.md) is a new way of deploying [OpenStack](https://openstack.org){:target="\_blank"} and [Kubernetes](kttps://k8s.io){:target="\_blank"} together to create a new type of unified cloud infrastructure.  Before diving into the Genestack details and inner-workings, it will be important to decide how you want to structure your cloud.
