# Deploy Barbican

OpenStack Barbican is the dedicated security service within the OpenStack ecosystem, focused on the secure storage, management, and provisioning of sensitive data such as encryption keys, certificates, and passwords. Barbican plays a crucial role in enhancing the security posture of cloud environments by providing a centralized and controlled repository for cryptographic secrets, ensuring that sensitive information is protected and accessible only to authorized services and users. It integrates seamlessly with other OpenStack services to offer encryption and secure key management capabilities, which are essential for maintaining data confidentiality and integrity. In this document, we will explore the deployment of OpenStack Barbican using Genestack. With Genestack, the deployment of Barbican is optimized, ensuring that cloud infrastructures are equipped with strong and scalable security measures for managing critical secrets.

## Create secrets

!!! note "Information about the secretes used"

    Manual secret generation is only required if you haven't run the `create-secrets.sh` script located in `/opt/genestack/bin`.

    ??? example "Example secret generation"

        ``` shell
        kubectl --namespace openstack \
                create secret generic barbican-rabbitmq-password \
                --type Opaque \
                --from-literal=username="barbican" \
                --from-literal=password="$(< /dev/urandom tr -dc _A-Za-z0-9 | head -c${1:-64};echo;)"
        kubectl --namespace openstack \
                create secret generic barbican-db-password \
                --type Opaque \
                --from-literal=password="$(< /dev/urandom tr -dc _A-Za-z0-9 | head -c${1:-32};echo;)"
        kubectl --namespace openstack \
                create secret generic barbican-admin \
                --type Opaque \
                --from-literal=password="$(< /dev/urandom tr -dc _A-Za-z0-9 | head -c${1:-32};echo;)"
        ```

## Run the package deployment

!!! example "Run the Barbican deployment Script `bin/install-barbican.sh`"

    ``` shell
    --8<-- "bin/install-barbican.sh"
    ```

!!! tip

    You may need to provide custom values to configure your openstack services, for a simple single region or lab deployment you can supply an additional overrides flag using the example found at `base-helm-configs/aio-example-openstack-overrides.yaml`.
    In other cases such as a multi-region deployment you may want to view the [Multi-Region Support](multi-region-support.md) guide to for a workflow solution.

### Custom Listeners

!!! note "This step is not needed if all listeners were applied when the Gateway API was deployed"

??? abstract "Example listener patch file found in `/opt/genestack/etc/gateway-api/listeners`"

    ``` yaml
    --8<-- "etc/gateway-api/listeners/barbican-https.json"
    ```

#### Modify the Listener Patch

This example changes the placeholder domain to `<YOUR_DOMAIN>`. Review the [gateway documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway)
for more information on listener types.

``` shell
mkdir -p /etc/genestack/gateway-api/listeners
sed 's/your.domain.tld/<YOUR_DOMAIN>/g' \
    /opt/genestack/etc/gateway-api/listeners/barbican-https.json \
    > /etc/genestack/gateway-api/listeners/barbican-https.json
```

#### Apply the Listener Patch

``` shell
kubectl patch -n nginx-gateway gateway flex-gateway \
              --type='json' \
              --patch-file /etc/genestack/gateway-api/listeners/barbican-https.json
```

### Custom Routes

!!! note "This step is not needed if all routes were applied when the Gateway API was deployed"

A custom gateway route can be used when setting up the service. The custom route make it possible to for a domain like `your.domain.tld` to be used for the service.

??? abstract "Example routes file found in `/opt/genestack/etc/gateway-api/routes`"

    ``` yaml
    --8<-- "etc/gateway-api/routes/custom-barbican-gateway-route.yaml"
    ```

#### Modify the Route

This example changes the placeholder domain to `<YOUR_DOMAIN>`. Review the [gateway route documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute)
for more information on route types.

``` shell
mkdir -p /etc/genestack/gateway-api/routes
sed 's/your.domain.tld/<YOUR_DOMAIN>/g' \
    /opt/genestack/etc/gateway-api/routes/custom-barbican-gateway-route.yaml \
    > /etc/genestack/gateway-api/routes/custom-barbican-gateway-route.yaml
```

#### Apply the Route

``` shell
kubectl --namespace openstack apply -f /etc/genestack/gateway-api/routes/custom-barbican-gateway-route.yaml
```
