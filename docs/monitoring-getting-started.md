# Getting started with genestack monitoring

In order to begin monitoring your genestack deployment we first need to deploy the core prometheus components

## Install the Prometheus stack

Install [Prometheus](prometheus.md) which is part of the kube-prometheus-stack and includes:

* Prometheus and the Prometheus operator to manage the Prometheus cluster deployment
* AlertManager which allows for alerting configurations to be set in order to notify various services like email or PagerDuty for specified alerting thresholds

The [Prometheus](prometheus.md) kube-prometheus-stack will also deploy a couple core metric exporters as part of the stack, those include:

* Node Exporter(Hardware metrics)
* Kube State Exporter(Kubernetes cluster metrics)

## Install Grafana

We can then deploy our visualization dashboard Grafana

* [Install Grafana](grafana.md)

Grafana is used to visualize various metrics provided by the monitoring system as well as alerts and logs, take a look at the [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) documentation for more information

## Install the metric exporters and pushgateway

Now let's deploy our exporters and pushgateway!

* [Mysql Exporter](prometheus-mysql-exporter.md)
* [RabbitMQ Exporter](prometheus-rabbitmq-exporter.md)
* [Postgres Exporter](prometheus-postgres-exporter.md)
* [Memcached Exporter](prometheus-memcached-exporter.md)
* [Openstack Exporter](prometheus-openstack-metrics-exporter.md)
* [Pushgateway](prometheus-pushgateway.md)

## Next steps

### Configure alert manager

Configure the alert manager to send the specified alerts to slack as an example, see: [Slack Alerts](alertmanager-slack.md)

... and more ...

### Update alerting rules

Within the genestack repo we can update our alerting rules via the alerting_rules.yaml to fit our needs

View alerting_rules.yaml in:

``` shell
less /etc/genestack/helm-configs/prometheus/alerting_rules.yaml
```
