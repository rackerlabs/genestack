# Upgrading Genestack from OpenStack 2024.1 (Caracal) to 2025.1 (Epoxy)

This guide outlines the process for upgrading a Genestack deployment from OpenStack 2024.1 (Caracal) to 2025.1 (Epoxy). Genestack leverages OpenStack-Helm charts for deployment and management, making upgrades primarily a matter of updating the underlying charts and configurations via Git and Helm.

OpenStack 2025.1 (Epoxy) is a Skip Level Upgrade Release Process (SLURP) release, which supports direct upgrades from the previous SLURP release (Caracal), skipping the intermediate 2024.2 (Dalmatian) release if desired. This simplifies the upgrade path for stable environments.

## Prerequisites

- A full backup of your current deployment, including databases, configurations.
- Familiarity with the Genestack installation process and operator documentation.
- Minimum downtime window planned, as some services will require restarts.
- Verify that no active jobs or migrations are running that could conflict with the upgrade.

## Upgrade Steps

The upgrade process is similar to a fresh installation but focuses on updating charts and applying revisions. Perform these steps on the management node.

1. **Navigate to the Genestack Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /opt/genestack
   ```

2. **Update the Git Repository:**
   - Fetch the latest changes:
   
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     git tag
     git checkout <Latest Epoxy Release>
     ```
   - If there is no release tag for Epoxy then you will need to update the images manually in the overrides
   
   ```bash
   *** Example ***
   
   keystone-helm-overrides.yaml
   
   images:
   
     tags:
     
       bootstrap: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/heat:2025.1-1750442748
       
       db_drop: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/heat:2025.1-1750442748
       
       db_init: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/heat:2025.1-1750442748
       
       keystone_api: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/keystone:2025.1-1750442703
       
       keystone_credential_cleanup: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/heat:2025.1-1750442748
       
       keystone_credential_rotate: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/keystone:2025.1-1750442703
       
       keystone_credential_setup: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/keystone:2025.1-1750442703
       
       keystone_db_sync: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/keystone:2025.1-1750442703
       
       keystone_domain_manage: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/keystone:2025.1-1750442703
       
       keystone_fernet_rotate: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/keystone:2025.1-1750442703
       
       keystone_fernet_setup: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/keystone:2025.1-1750442703
       
       ks_user: ghcr.io/aedan/genestack-images/heat:2025.1-1750442748
```

4. **Handle Pre-Upgrade Cleanups:**
   - Clean up Nova jobs to avoid conflicts:
   
     ```bash
     kubectl --namespace openstack delete jobs $(kubectl --namespace openstack get jobs --no-headers -o custom-columns=":metadata.name" | grep nova)
     ```

5. **Apply Updated Helm Charts:**
   - Re-run the Helm deployments for OpenStack components, following your original installation guide.
    
     ```bash
     /opt/genestack/setup-openstack.sh
     ```
   - Or apply in sequence: Keystone, Glance, Nova, Neutron, etc., monitoring each for completion.
   
   Example for a basic OpenStack chart upgrade:
   
   ```bash
   /opt/genestack/bin/install-keystone.sh
   /opt/genestack/bin/install-glance.sh
   /opt/genestack/bin/install-nova.sh
   ```

7. **Post-Upgrade Verification:**
   - Check pod status:
   
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
     ```
   - Run OpenStack health checks:
   
     ```bash
     openstack endpoint list
     openstack compute service list
     openstack network agent list
     openstack volume service list
     ```
   - Test key functionalities (e.g., instance provisioning, networking).
   - Monitor logs for errors:
   
     ```bash
     kubectl logs -f <pod-name>
     ```
