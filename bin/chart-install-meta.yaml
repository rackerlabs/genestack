# This files generally tries to match the naming conventions for a
# kustomization.yaml with `helmCharts`, but has some mostly necessary
# deviations.
#
# Field names matching `helmCharts` from a kustomization.yaml:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These values have the same name and function as in a `helmCharts` stanza.
#
# - repo: URL for the repo for the chart
# - name: name of the chart to install from the repo
# - namespace: The namespace to install in.
#     - This will often, but only incidentally, match the `releaseName`.
# - releaseName: identical to a `helmCharts` entry
#      - However, since we install with a script, actually shows up as a release
#        with `helm list`.
#      - This will often, but only incidentally, match the `name`.
#
# Field names matching `helmCharts` from a kustomization.yaml, optional:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# - version: Specify a chart version.
#
# Slightly different from `helmCharts` in a `kustomization.yaml`:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This shows slight differences between a `helmCharts` stanza and what you put
# here.
#
# - valuesFiles: This includes all values files listed in order to apply them.
#     - A separate `valuesFile` field seems unnecessary, so this should
#       frequently have `values.yaml` as the first, and often the only, list
#       entry.
#     - Notably, subsumes the functionality of `additionalValuesFiles` from
#       a `helmConfig`, as it simply applies all specified values files in
#       order.
#
# - first line as _Genestack_ component name
#    - `helmCharts` takes a list and has a `name` field that refers to the
#       name of the chart from the repo. For the purpose of identifying the
#       _Genestack_ component, the identification for each entry will
#       frequently duplicate the `name` as used to identify a chart in the
#       repo, but may or may not differ, e.g., `prometheus:` refers to
#       Prometheus proper as a _Genestack_ component, but has `name`
#       `kube-prometheus-stack` as the chart name from the repo, while
#       `prometheus-pushgateway:` ALSO has `name: prometheus-pushgateway` as
#       overall top-level identifier matching the `name.
#
# Required here but not in a stanza of `helmCharts`
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This doesn't appear in a `helmCharts` stanza of a `kustomization.yaml`, but
# you have to supply it here.
#
# - repoName: name for the repo as shown by `helm repo list`.
#    - Using `kustomization.yaml` doesn't create a repo shown by
#      `helm repo list` so this needed adding.
#
# Not required here and not in a stanza of `helmCharts`
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# - timeout: amount of time allowed for `helm install` to complete
#    - optional because it defaults to 10m
#    - no equivalent exists in a `helmCharts` stanza
# - overlayDir: name of directory under
#   /etc/genestack/kustomize/<SERVICE_NAME>/ for base or overlays.
#    - optional, defaults to 'overlay'
#
# Notable differences
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - includeCRDs: not used
#     - This often gets used in `helmCharts` in kustomization.yaml, but
#       invoking `helm` directly installs CRDs by default unless you
#       specify `--skip-crds`, so doesn't appear here.
# - additionalValuesFiles: not used
#     - As mentioned above, this list just goes under `valuesFiles` here, where
#       all items of the list get applied in order.
