    When upgrading from a previous release of Genestack, if SAML Federation
    was enabled, you must update the HTTP Routes for both Keystone and
    Skyline. During the development of the SAML Federation feature,
    Keystone and Skyline HTTRoutes were updated to have cookie driven session
    persistence to ensure compatibility with Shibboleth.

    ::

      Full example files for the HTTP Routes can be found in the
      ``etc/gateway-api/routes`` directory.

    The following stanza should be added to the HTTP Routes for Keystone; file typically
    located at ``/etc/genestack/gateway-api/routes/custom-keystone-gateway-route.yaml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      sessionPersistence:
        sessionName: KeystoneSession
        type: Cookie
        absoluteTimeout: 300s
        cookieConfig:
          lifetimeType: Permanent

    The following stanza should be added to the HTTP Routes for Skyline; file typically
    located at ``/etc/genestack/gateway-api/routes/custom-skyline-gateway-route.yaml``.

    .. code-block:: yaml

      sessionPersistence:
        sessionName: SkylineSession
        type: Cookie
        absoluteTimeout: 300s
        cookieConfig:
          lifetimeType: Permanent

    Once the configuration is updated, Run the deployment update with the
    following apply commands.

    .. code-block:: shell

      kubectl -n openstack apply -f /etc/genestack/gateway-api/routes/custom-keystone-gateway-route.yaml
      kubectl -n openstack apply -f /etc/genestack/gateway-api/routes/custom-skyline-gateway-route.yaml

    Once the HTTP Routes are updated, verify that the changes have been
    applied by checking the status of the HTTP Routes.

    .. code-block:: shell

      kubectl -n openstack get httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io custom-keystone-gateway-route -o yaml
      kubectl -n openstack get httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io custom-skyline-gateway-route -o yaml
