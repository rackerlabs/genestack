    The gnocchi chart will now use the online OSH helm repository. This change
    will allow the gnocchi chart to be updated more frequently and will allow
    the gnocchi chart to be used with the OpenStack-Helm project. Upgrading to
    this chart may require changes to the deployment configuration. Simple
    updates can be made by running the following command:

    .. code-block:: shell

      helm -n openstack uninstall gnocchi
      kubectl -n openstack delete -f /etc/genestack/kustomize/gnocchi/base/gnocchi-rabbitmq-queue.yaml
      /opt/genestack/bin/install-gnocchi.sh
