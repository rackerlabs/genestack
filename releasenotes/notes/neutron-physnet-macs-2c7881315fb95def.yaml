    Operators upgrading from an early build will need to ensure that the OVN-Setup
    manifest is re-applied so that the MAC address of the neutron physical network
    interface is set. Operators who chose to not run this manifest will need will
    need to set their MAC addresses manually.

    See https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/install/ovn/manual_install.html
    for more information on the manual OVN Setup process.
