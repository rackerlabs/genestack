    The octavia chart will now use the online OSH helm repository. This change
    will allow the octavia chart to be updated more frequently and will allow
    the octavia chart to be used with the OpenStack-Helm project. Upgrading to
    this chart may require changes to the deployment configuration. Simple
    updates can be made by running the following command:

    .. code-block:: shell

      helm -n openstack uninstall octavia
      kubectl -n openstack delete -f /etc/genestack/kustomize/octavia/base/octavia-rabbitmq-queue.yaml
      /opt/genestack/bin/install-octavia.sh

    Depending on the state of the Octavia deployment, it may be nessessary to
    rerun the ansible-playbook for the octavia deployment. Note that this playbook
    will drop a marker file ``/tmp/octavia_hm_controller_ip_port_list`` which may
    need to be cleaned up before rerunning the playbook.

    That said, if the deployment was healthy before, the cleanup steps should not
    be needed. This operation should have no operational impact on running VMs but
    should be performed during a maintenance window.
