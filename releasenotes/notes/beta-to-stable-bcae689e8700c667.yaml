    Skyline UI currently limits the loadbalancer types to Amphora. This is a known
    issue and will be resolved in a future release.
upgrade:
  - |
    When upgrading from a pre-release to stable, the following changes will need
    to be made to the ansible inventory or group_vars to support stable cert-manager

    .. code-block:: yaml

        cert_manager_controller_extra_args:
          - "--enable-gateway-api"

    In previous builds the ``--enable-gateway-api`` was unset, but it is now a
    required option.
  - |
    When upgrading from a pre-release to stable, the following changes will need
    to be made to the ansible inventory or group_vars to support stable metallb

    .. code-block:: yaml

        metallb_enabled: false

    In previous builds the ``metallb_enabled`` was set to true, but it is now
    managed by the MetalLB helm chart.
  - |
    When upgrading from a pre-release to stable, the following changes will need
    to be made to the ansible inventory or group_vars to eliminate the CNI plugin
    from the Kubespray Management.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        kube_network_plugin: none

    In previous builds the ``kube_network_plugin`` was set to kube-ovn, but it is
    now managed by the Kube-OVN helm chart.
  - |
    When upgrading from a pre-release to stable, the following changes will need
    to be made to the ansible inventory or group_vars to eliminate the previous
    assumption of the kubeadm patch files.

    .. code-block:: yaml

        kubeadm_patches: []

    In previous builds the ``kubeadm_patches`` was set to a dictionary of patches
    that would deploy files into the environment. This interface was changed
    upstream and now must be a list of string type patches. Review the upstream
    documentation[0] for more information.

    [0] https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/blob/v2.27.0/roles/kubernetes/kubeadm_common/defaults/main.yml
  - |
    When upgrading from a pre-release to stable, the following file no longer has
    any effect on the environment and can be removed from the ansible group_vars.


    /etc/genestack/inventory/group_vars/k8s_cluster/k8s-net-kube-ovn.yml

    This file can be eliminated.
  - |
    When upgrading from a pre-release to stable, review the Kube-OVN to Helm
    migration documentation at https://docs.rackspacecloud.com/k8s-cni-kube-ovn-helm-conversion
    as this step will be required before running Kubespray again.
deprecations:
  - |
    In early builds of Genestack Kube-OVN was deployed and managed by Kubespray;
    however, this is no longer the case. The Kube-OVN helm chart is now used to
    deploy and manage the Kube-OVN CNI plugin.
  - |
    In early builds of Genestack MetalLB was deployed and managed by Kubespray;
    however, this is no longer the case. The MetalLB helm chart is now used to
    deploy and manage the MetalLB LoadBalancer.
  - |
    In early builds of Genestack the cert-manager option ``ExperimentalGatewayAPISupport``
    was set to true, within the ansible group_vars. This option should be removed as it
    no longer has any effect.
