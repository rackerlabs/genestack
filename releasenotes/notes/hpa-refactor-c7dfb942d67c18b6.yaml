    HPA will now trigger off CPU utilization as well as RAM consumption.
    OpenStack services ram consumption is fairly static based on the number
    of workers, threads, and processes.  With this change, CPU consumption
    will now also be considered for horizontal auto scaling.

    In order to ensure that HPA has been properly tuned for a 3-node
    hyper-converged lab deployment (our recommended lab/testing deployment)
    this change will also standardize, across all OpenStack services, the
    number of workers to 2, the number or processes to 2, and the number of
    threads per process to 1.
    Additionally, we will reduce the minReplicas from 3 to 2 to reduce
    overall resource usage while still maintaining a fault tolerant cluster.

    While this is NOT a breaking change, it will change the resource consumption
    of any deployment going forward.

    Current HPA values included in this change were determined using the,
    workers=2, processes=2, and threads=1 model.  A hyper-converged lab was
    created and workers, processes,threads reduced to provide a baseline of
    resource usage.  From pod requests and limits were adjusted to take into
    account the baseline resource consumption.

    In base-helm-configs, por resources needed to be enabled and the
    requests/limits configured.  If limits is set to {} it is pulling
    the defaults from the Helm chart.
    [example]
      resources:
        enabled: true
        api:
          requests:
            memory: "384Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
          limits: {}
